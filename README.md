MCP server for devcontainer to generate and configure development containers directly from devcontainer.json configuration files.

## 📌 Pre-condition

This project is built with Node.js. For local development, you can either:
- Install `Node.js` on your machine, or  
- Use the provided [devcontainer](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) virtual environment.

You may run the project without installing `Node.js` locally by using `npx`:
```bash
npx -y mcp-devcontainers
```

**Docker is required** in the execution environment:
- For **local MCP server**: Install Docker on your local machine  
- For **remote MCP server**: Install Docker on the remote server  

> 📦 Docker installation guide: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/

## 🚀 Getting Started
- Build: `npm run build` - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
- Watch mode: `npm run watch` - Automatically rebuilds on file changes
- Prepare release: `npm run prepare` - Prepares the package for publishing
- Run ESLint: `npm run lint` - Executes ESLint for code validation
- Fix ESLint issues: `npm run lint:fix` - Automatically fixes ESLint errors

## MCP Transport

- Start server: `npm start` - Launches the MCP server with **stdio transport**
- Start SSE server: `npm start sse` - Runs the MCP server with **Server-Sent Events transport**
- Start Streamable HTTP server: `npm start http` - Starts the MCP server with **Streamable HTTP transport**

## 📚 Tools

Tools are built on the [devcontainers/cli](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli)

They enable you to generate and configure development containers directly from `devcontainer.json` configuration files:

- ### devcontainer_up
  - workspaceFolder: Path to the workspace folder (string)
  - outputFilePath: Path for output logs (string)

> Initializes and starts a devcontainer environment in the specified workspace folder. Ensures the devcontainer is operational and ready for development tasks.


- ### devcontainer_run_user_commands
  - workspaceFolder: Path to the workspace folder (string)
  - outputFilePath: Path for output logs (string)

> Executes user-defined postCreateCommand and postStartCommand scripts within the devcontainer for the specified workspace. Use this to run setup or initialization tasks after container startup.


- ###  devcontainer_exec
  - workspaceFolder: Path to the workspace folder (string)
  - outputFilePath: Path for output logs (string)
  - command: Command to execute (array of string)

> Runs a custom shell command inside the devcontainer for the specified workspace. Useful for executing arbitrary commands or scripts within the devcontainer environment.
